# Input-Output Redirections and Pipes (>,>>,|,2>, &>)

By using special notions we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices and even to the input of others commands.

## Standard Output, >, or stdout: 
Writes data that is generated by a program or command. When Standard Output is not redirected with `>` it outputs the text to terminal. When redirected, it will output/save to file. 

**Example:**
Lets say you want to create a copied file of `/etc/nsswitch.conf` named nsswtichcontent

**Step1:** Use stdout redirection on `/etc/nsswitch.conf` and name file nsswitchcontent

Verify its content with `cat nsswitchcontent`

## Standard Error, 2>, or stderr:

Writes the errors generated by a program that has failed at some point in its execution. When Standard Error is redirected with `2>` it outputs the text to file.

**Eample:**

**Step 1:** Create random error and use stderr redirection on new file named `randomerrors.txt`

![Step1](/imgs/redirections/stderr1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Verify that the error has saved to file by using `cat randomerrors.txt` (in this case the error is randomerrors is not a command)

## Appending(adding) Standard Ouput Redirection, >> : 
Adds to a file using standard output.

**Example:**

**Step1:** Verify file previously created file `cat randomerrors.txt` to see its content.

**Step2:** Add random note to it using Appending stdout redirection (>>)

**Step3:** Verify that the random note is appended to file `cat randomerrors.txt`

## Standard Input, <, or stdin:
Usually input expected from the keyboard. Could be a form of user input from a program or from a command line argument.

**Eample:**

**Step 1:** Create File Using Standard Output (>) 

![Step1](/imgs/redirections/stdin1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Use stdin redirection with `wc -w` on that file

![Step2](/imgs/redirections/stdin2.jpg)


**Step 3:** Append (>>) to that same file.

![Step3](/imgs/redirections/stdin3.jpg)


**Step 4:** Use stdin on that file with `wc -w` again.

## Pipes or | :
Pipes are used to redirect a stream from one program to another. When a program's standard output is sent to another through a pipe, the first program's data, which is received by the second program, will not be displayed on the terminal. Only the filtered commands would be displayed (find, grep, tee, tr, wc, etc..).

**Example:**
Lets say you forgot how to create a repository but you remember that an example is in the manual for yum.conf. The man page is too long so you want to pipe (|) using grep to search for the term 'repository'

**Step 1:** Use command `man yum.conf` and pipe it with the command `grep` searching for the strings repository : `man yum.conf | grep repository`
